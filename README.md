# SODA for SPARC Documentation

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Project setup

Make sure to install the dependencies for this project using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

```bash
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000. This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

```bash
yarn start
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

Use this step to build a local production version of the site. Use `serve` to preview the local build.

```bash
yarn build
yarn serve
```

We recommend to look at the [documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs).

Note: You will not need to do anything to the hosted site. Continuous Delivery has been setup with Vercel. All you need to do is push your commit and wait for it to deploy.

A special thank you to Vercel for hosting this website.
