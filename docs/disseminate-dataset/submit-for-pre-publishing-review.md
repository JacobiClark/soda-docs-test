# Submit for pre publishing review

## Background

One year after the dataset completion date (as per the Data Deliverables document) or right after publishing results from the dataset, whichever comes first, you must publish your dataset to Pennsieve Discover, which populates the SPARC Data Portal, and make it public.

As per the SPARC publishing process, when ready for publishing, you must submit your dataset for review again to the Curation Team who will make a final check of your dataset and accept or reject the publication request. If accepted, the dataset will be published automatically on Pennsieve Discover. Otherwise, the Curation Team will inform you of the reasons for rejecting.

## How to

1. Select/confirm your Pennsieve account and dataset. If you have not connected your Pennsieve account with SODA yet, use the instructions available here.
2. Click on "Submit". The dataset could also be withdrawn from review by clicking on "Withdraw from review".
