To use SODA, first download and install the [Pennsieve Agent](https://app.pennsieve.net/).

### Windows (developed and tested on Windows 10)

2. Double click on the installer (.exe file), it will start the installation process (if there is a permission issue try to right-click and select "Run as administrator").
3. Follow the installation instructions.
4. Once the application is installed, you can run the application by either running the desktop shortcut, searching for "SODA" on the start menu, or from the installation folder.
5. To stop the application, simply click on the cross in the top right corner.

The downloaded installer file could be deleted since it is not necessary to run SODA. The SODA app can be uninstalled from the Program manager (under Control Panel) like any other app on Windows.

### macOS (developed and tested on macOS Catalina 10.15)

3. To stop the application, click on the red circle/button in the top left corner.

The downloaded installer could be deleted since it is not necessary to run SODA. To uninstall the SODA app, simply delete it from your computerâ€™s "Applications" folder.

### Ubuntu (developed and tested on Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS)

1. [Download Linux AppImage](https://github.com/fairdataihub/SODA-for-SPARC/releases/download/v5.1.0/SODA-for-SPARC-Setup-5.1.0.exe).
2. Right-click on the downloaded file and go to the permissions tab.

4. Double click the downloaded SODA app icon and it should open the app.

Since our Linux SODA app is in the AppImage format, you can move this file anywhere on your computer and run it. If you would like to move the app into the applications older, we recommend you use the open-source [AppImage Launcher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) to organize and handle all AppImage programs for your Linux system
