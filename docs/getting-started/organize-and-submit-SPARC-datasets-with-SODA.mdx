organization (contact support@pennsieve.net for help)

through SODA.

<br />

<Checkbox /> Open SODA and watch our quick video located under the Overview tab
to familiarize yourself with the user interface of SODA.

### Prepare Dataset on Pennsieve (under the Manage Datasets tab of the Free Form Mode)

<Checkbox /> Connect your Pennsieve account with SODA. This is only required the
first time you use SODA.

<br />

<Checkbox /> Create a new dataset
