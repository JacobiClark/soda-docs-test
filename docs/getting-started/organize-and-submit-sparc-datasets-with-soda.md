The typical process for curating and sharing a dataset according to the SPARC guidelines consists of:

- Organizing your data according to the SPARC Data Structure (SDS)
- Adding metadata files
- Uploading everything on the Pennsieve data platform where more metadata needs to be added,
- Finally sharing the dataset with the SPARC Curation Team who will review it for compliance and help with subsequent steps until your dataset becomes accessible publicly through the [SPARC Data Portal](https://sparc.science/).

We describe below the suggested steps for implementing this process with SODA. It differs slightly depending on if you are sharing a dataset associated with a SPARC funded study (i.e., a SPARC dataset) or not (i.e., a non-SPARC dataset).

### A. Initial inquiry

The process for sharing non-SPARC data on the SPARC data portal starts with reaching out via email to the SPARC Curation team (curation@sparc.science). Include briefly information about the data you want to share and the SPARC Curation team will follow up with you regarding the suitability of your data for the SPARC data portal.

### B. Preliminary steps

These steps only need to be completed once.

- All SPARC datasets must be uploaded on the Pennsieve data platform. Get access to Pennsieve as well as the SPARC organization on Pennsieve by filling out [this form](https://www.wrike.com/frontend/requestforms/index.html?token=eyJhY2NvdW50SWQiOjMyMDM1ODgsInRhc2tGb3JtSWQiOjUwMzQzN30JNDgwNTg4NjU3MjA3Nwk0MTg5ZTY0ODEyZGYxNTU1ZDJkYmU5MzIxNWZiNTQyZWUwZTMzY2U4NDQ5ODI0ZWI0YzZiMWZhNjVhYzgyOTRm).
- Download and install the [Pennsieve agent](https://docs.pennsieve.io/docs/uploading-files-programmatically) required to upload files through SODA (ignore the deprecation warning)

### C. Curate and share data with SODA

Use the `End to End Curation Mode` of SODA, accessible through the `Curate and Share` section on the sidebar of the app, for preparing and sharing your dataset according
to the SPARC guidelines. The End to End Curation Mode is intended to guide users step-by-step through all the requirements for curating and sharing datasets according
to the SPARC data standards. The user interfaces of the Guided Mode are designed to logically guide users through the curation steps and include all necessary information
such that no prior knowledge of the SPARC data standards is required.
