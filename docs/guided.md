### What is End to End Curation?

End to End Curation Mode is a workflow of curating datasets step-by-step entirely through SODA, accessible through the `Curate and Share` option of the sidebar. It is preparing
and sharing your dataset according to the SPARC guidelines and is intended to guide users step-by-step through all the requirements. The user interfaces of the End to End
Curation Mode are designed to logically guide users through the curation steps and include all necessary information such that no prior knowledge of the SPARC data standards
is required.
