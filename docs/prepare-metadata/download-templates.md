# Download templates

## Background

The Curation Team has release templates for all the metadata files required in SPARC datasets. These templates are available in SPARC Dataset Structure which may be downloaded as a zip file. They are used in SODA when generating the metadata files. You can also download them conveniently in this SODA feature in case you wish to fill them out manually.

## How to

Simply click on the name of the file and select the destination folder to download.
